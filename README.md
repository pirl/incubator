A hodlers club is a smart contract (DApp) which lets you lock up your until a target price in USD is reached. The Dapp is designed for anyone who wishes to avoid impulse selling because of FUD. "Cowards" who leave the club before the price is reached, leave behind a small percentage of their which is shared amongst the "Mature Hodlers" (e.g. hodlers who have waited for the target price to be reached). So by joining the club, you can hodl your coins until they Moon and maybe get a few extra coins if Cowards leave.
